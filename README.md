Interactive visualization dashboard in Python with [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/).

This repository contains code for a portfolio project showcasing an interactive dashboard built with Panel.

If you want to see all the dependencies for this project, please refer to the `requirements.txt` file.

## Overview

This project offers an interactive visualization dashboard that models both Bitcoin mining performance and detailed economic metrics across the 2026-2030 period. It dynamically scales operational and financial indicators based on power consumption and economic assumptions, allowing users to explore realistic nonlinear growth patterns, investment impacts, and forecast scenarios.

## Model Structure

- **Data Preparation and Cleaning**  
  Processes datasets relevant for 2026-2030, including forecasts of operating metrics, capital expenditures, revenues, costs, and depreciatio.

- **Dynamic Metrics Scaling Functions**  
  Applies nonlinear growth functions to scale key metrics by power input (MW):
  - Slow logarithmic growth for cost-related metrics (energy cost, OPEX, CAPEX amortization, taxes, total costs).
  - Combined square root and logarithmic growth for gross revenues and net profits, modeling controlled, faster growth with diminishing returns.

- **Economic Metric Calculations**  
  Computes aggregate financial indicators‚Äîincluding total income, investment dynamics, depreciation expenses, cost breakdowns, and annual net returns‚Äîcapturing temporal compounding and scenario variations over 2026-2030.

- **Interactive Dashboard Components**  
  Provides widgets (sliders, dropdowns) for adjusting power consumption over the year, enabling real-time updates of metrics, charts and tables.

## Economic & Mining Key Metrics Summary

| Metric                   | Description & Behavior (2026-2030)                                                               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Income**          | Aggregated annual revenues, dynamically scaled with power input and economic assumptions.        |
| **Investment Dynamics**   | Yearly capital expenditures and depreciation, reflecting asset utilization and financial impact. |
| **Cost Components**       | Detailed fixed and variable costs, scaled logarithmically to reflect operational realities.      |
| **Gross Revenue**         | Scaled using mixed sqrt and logarithmic growth functions for controlled faster revenue growth.   |
| **Net Profits**           | Similarly scaled with parameters permitting slightly higher growth than revenues.                |
| **Scenario Analysis**     | Enables sensitivity exploration by modifying discount rates, investment levels, and power input. |


### üöÄ How to Run

To serve the dashboard locally, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
panel serve interact-ui-dashboard.ipynb --port 5010 --show
```
